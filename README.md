### Documentation

This is a Python snippet that integrates ChatGPT API with a system instruction that gives ChatGPT an inner thoUght process. It follows chain-of-thought prompting principles where the model will 'plan' before responding with an answer or guidance. It is specifically inspired by Josh Tenenbaum's lecture on incorporating models of the world, comprising of objects and agents with beliefs and goals, to artificial intelligence systems.

### Use Case

You can implement this code in your ChatGPT assistant to improve the model's answer quality. You can also use the prompt in other non-ChatGPT applications.
